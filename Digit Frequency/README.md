# Digit Frequency

 ## Explination:
  - Count the numbers in the string and print how many times it occurs
  
 ## Algorithm:
  - Get the string from the user max length is 1000
  - Make array have 9 element (form 0 to 9) intiate with 0
  - Make for loop to go through the string:
    - Make for loop and check:
      - If the s[index]-'0' (get the actual number) == index 
        - increse the counter by one
      - Add the counter to the array 
   - Then print the array
